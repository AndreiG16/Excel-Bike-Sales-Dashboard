# Excel-Bike-Sales-Dashboard

The goal of this Bike Sales Dashboard is to analyze sales data by segmenting it across key demographic and behavioral factors such as income, gender, age, commute distance, marital status, region, education, and occupation. This helps identify trends and insights, such as the influence of income and age on purchasing decisions or commuting patterns of customers, enabling the business to optimize marketing strategies, target specific customer groups, and make data-driven decisions to boost sales and operational efficiency.
